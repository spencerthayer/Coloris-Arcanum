## General Game Play

The objective of Colos Magus is to be the first player to complete 3 full-color sets. Each color sets tells you how many cards you need of that color to complete the set.

For example, the white and grey color sets only need 2 grey color sets to be completed and the black set needs 4 black color sets to be a completed set. Each color sets tells you how many cards you need of that color to complete the set.

Each player is dealt 5 cards at the start of the game and then picks up 2 cards from the remaining draw pile at the beginning of each turn.

Each player can play up to 3 cards per turn. A play is considered any time a card is played on the table (such as mana into your mana pool, color sets on the table, action cards played into the middle, etc). You do not need to play all 3 cards per turn if you do not want to.

At the end of each playerâ€™s turn, they cannot have more than 7 cards in their hand. If they do, they need to discard the excess cards into the discard pile.

### Starting & Dealing the Game

#### Step 1: Determining the dealer and player initiative.
Each player will blindly grab a card from the deck. The player possessing the card with the highest mana value is the dealer and will go first after dealing.

#### Step 2: Shuffle the deck.
Colos Magus has more cards than a typical deck so the dealer will need to split the cards up into multiple sections to provide an adequate shuffle.

#### Step 3: Dealing the cards.
Each player will receive 5 cards. Distribute one card to each player one at a time. 

#### Step 4: Setup the game.
Put the remaining cards in the middle partition zone face down. This will be the draw pile. 

#### Step 5:  Begin the game
Starting with the dealer play clockwise around the table. Play until a player completes 3 full-color sets to win that game!

### What does a Player do on Their Turn

## The Hand - Picking Up and Laying Down

Pick up Two Colos Magus Cards During a Turn and Lay Down Up to Three
Each player must pick up 2 cards from the draw pile during each turn.

There are 4 places where cards can be at play during a turn:

- A player can play mana or second order cards face up in their mana pool.
- A player can play cards face up in the middle partition zone.
- A player can move color cards from the partition zone face up to their color section.
- A player can add cards to the discard pile.

Then each player can play up to 3 cards on their turn. (a play is considered any card you lay onto the table such as mana into your mana pool, color sets on the table, action cards played into the middle, etc). You do not need to lay all 3 card plays if you do not want to.
