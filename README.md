## Quick Play  Guide

Colōris Arcānum is a game centered around conjuring and collecting colors, attacking opponents, and surviving cataclysms. The main objective of Colōris Arcānum is to be the first player to complete 3 full-color sets. To achieve this goal players use action cards to attack, swap cards, use spells to demand tribute, and a whole lot more.

After initiative is determined each player is dealt 5 cards at the start of the game. At the beginning of each turn, players will add 2 cards to their hand from the remaining draw pile.  At the end of a turn, a player cannot have more than 7 cards in their hand. If they do, they will need to discard their chosen excess cards into the discard pile. If at the end of a turn a player has run out of cards, they will need to draw 5 at the start of their next turn.

Each player can play up to 3 cards per turn. A play is considered any time a card is played on the table (such as mana into your mana pool, color sets on the table, or action cards played into the partition zone, etc). You do not need to play all 3 cards per turn if you do not want to. Some cards such as deck and cataclysm cards do not count as a play.

## How To Play

### Starting The Game

__Step 1: Determining the dealer and player initiative.__ Each player will blindly grab a card from the deck. The player possessing the card with the highest mana value is the dealer and will go first after dealing.

__Step 2: Shuffle the deck.__ Colōris Arcānum has more cards than a typical deck so the dealer will need to split the cards up into multiple sections to provide an adequate shuffle.

__Step 3: Dealing the cards.__ Each player will receive 5 cards. Deal one card to each player one at a time. 

__Step 4: Setup the game.__ Put the remaining cards in the partition zone face down. This will be the draw pile. 

__Step 5:  Begin the game.__ Start play with the dealer and play clockwise around the table.

### What does a Player do on Their Turn

There are four places where cards can be played during a turn:
- A player can play a mana card or action card face up in their mana pool.
- A player can play cards face up in the partition zone.
- A player can move color cards from the partition zone face up to their color section.
- A player can add any card in-hand to the discard pile.

#### Explaining The Mana Pool

There are several ways to accumulate mana into the mana pool.

First, a player can put mana cards or action cards into the mana pool from their hand. If you put an Action card into your pool, it becomes redundant as an Action card for the rest of the game. If you use dispense action card to another player, it must go straight into their pool and cannot be used for its action.

Players can also use a combination of color and attack cards to take mana from each other. 

#### Explaining Attacks on Mana

Players can attack other players for mana from their pool, colors cards, or a combination of both. The defending player chooses how they want to dispense their cards – not the attacker! A player can NEVER dispense cards from their hand, only from the cards already in play.

Change is not given! For example, if a player attacks for ◇2 and then the defender only has ◇3 in their pool, they don’t get change back. If a player is forced to dispense color cards, those cards can only go into the attacking player’s color collection. If a player has no cards in play then the player does not dispense any cards to the attacker. 

Cards NEVER go back into a player’s hand, unless using the Resurrection spell card.

#### Using Action Cards

Action cards allow players to do things such as attack other players, steal their cards, and use spells like Allurement to force players to surrender mana. Follow the rules and instructions for each action card printed on the card.

Action cards can also be used for mana in the mana pool. The mana value for each action card is shown in the corner.

#### Conjuring and Capturing Color Cards

Remember, 3 different-colored color sets win the game. Lay color cards down in front of you to build up your color sets.

Each card shows how many colors there are to collect in that color-set.

Collect as many colors as you want, but you need 3 full sets (of different colors) to win the game.

You can only organize your color collection on your turn. If you realize you’ve won during someone else’s turn, you must wait until it’s your turn to say it!
